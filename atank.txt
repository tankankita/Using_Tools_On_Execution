This one is giveaway!!!
all we have to do is run the executable file. Run it in gdb and it will say that you won and will display the 0th secret thats is "".

1.
First go into gdb of the executable file. Put a breakpoint at line 1. 
Run the executable inside the gdb. Keep going to the next line until you see the message:
"behold! I will only tell you the secret password if you enter the random number  just generated!" 
which you'll see tath it's at line number 21. 
Then enter the command 'info locals' which will give a random number. 
Go to the next line and enter the random number, 
then keep going to the next line until the secret displays on the screen. 
Ane there you've FOUND THE SECRET.

2.
The password is 'Yes' because the exit status is 0 whic means the command was executed successfully.
3.
First, ltrace the executable file. After running the executable file with ltrace,
you'll see on the display screen that the it's unfinished and it's checking for the
existence file "iamspecial". ltrace also, gives a hint by saying that there's a 
file with a special name and gives a name of the file. 
Now create a file and name it the same name that was displayed on the screen before.
In this case it would be 'iamspecial'. After creating the file, run the command 'chmod 777 <filename>' 
which will change the file permissions to readable, writeable, and executable. 
Then run the executable file.The screen should display a message 
saying that the correct file is found and also display the secret.
